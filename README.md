## Linear Search

### Description
Linear search is a simple algorithm that checks every element in a list until the desired element is found or the list ends.

### Implementation
- File: `linear_search.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Binary Search

### Description
Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Implementation
- File: `binary_search.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Circular Queue

### Description
A circular queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, but the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.

### Implementation
- File: `circular_queue.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Queue

### Description
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle, where elements are added from the rear and removed from the front.

### Implementation
- File: `queue.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Stack using Array

### Description
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, where elements are added and removed from the top.

### Implementation
- File: `stack_array.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Polynomial Addition

### Description
This algorithm adds two polynomials represented as arrays.

### Implementation
- File: `polynomial_addition.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Infix to Postfix Conversion

### Description
This algorithm converts infix expressions (like `A + B`) to postfix expressions (like `AB+`) using a stack.

### Implementation
- File: `infix_to_postfix.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Linked List

### Description
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

### Implementation
- File: `linked_list.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Polynomial Addition using Linked List

### Description
This algorithm adds two polynomials represented as linked lists.

### Implementation
- File: `polynomial_addition_linked_list.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.
