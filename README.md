## Linear Search

### Description
Linear search is a simple algorithm that checks every element in a list until the desired element is found or the list ends.

### Implementation
- File: `linear_search.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Binary Search

### Description
Binary search is a more efficient algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

### Implementation
- File: `binary_search.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Circular Queue

### Description
A circular queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In First Out) principle, but the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle.

### Implementation
- File: `circular_queue.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Queue

### Description
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO principle, where elements are added from the rear and removed from the front.

### Implementation
- File: `queue.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Stack using Array

### Description
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle, where elements are added and removed from the top.

### Implementation
- File: `stack_array.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Polynomial Addition

### Description
This algorithm adds two polynomials represented as arrays.

### Implementation
- File: `polynomial_addition.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Infix to Postfix Conversion

### Description
This algorithm converts infix expressions (like `A + B`) to postfix expressions (like `AB+`) using a stack.

### Implementation
- File: `infix_to_postfix.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Linked List

### Description
A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

### Implementation
- File: `linked_list.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Polynomial Addition using Linked List

### Description
This algorithm adds two polynomials represented as linked lists.

### Implementation
- File: `polynomial_addition_linked_list.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

## Sparse Matrix

### Description
A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Efficient storage methods are used to save space.

### Implementation
- File: `sparse_matrix.c`
- Example usage and testing provided in the file.

  ## Sorting Algorithms

### Description
Sorting algorithms are methods for arranging the elements of a list or array in a specific order. Below are some common sorting algorithms:

#### Quick Sort
- **Description**: Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays.
- **Implementation**: 
  - File: `quick_sort.c`
  - Example usage and testing provided in the file.

#### Insertion Sort
- **Description**: Insertion sort builds a sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking an element from the unsorted portion and inserting it into the correct position.
- **Implementation**: 
  - File: `insertion_sort.c`
  - Example usage and testing provided in the file.

#### Selection Sort
- **Description**: Selection sort divides the input list into two parts: a sorted and an unsorted part, and repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part.
- **Implementation**: 
  - File: `selection_sort.c`
  - Example usage and testing provided in the file.

#### Merge Sort
- **Description**: Merge sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the two sorted halves back together. It is efficient for large datasets and has a time complexity of O(n log n).
- **Implementation**: 
  - File: `merge_sort.c`
  - Example usage and testing provided in the file.
